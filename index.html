            <p>
              Our literature survey reviewed more than 50 scholarly articles and industry studies published between 2015–2025 on AI-driven health management, fitness adherence, and predictive analytics. Several core themes were identified, including the rise of machine learning in personalized healthcare, the use of neural networks for health risk prediction, and the integration of conversational AI for continuous user engagement and motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The survey revealed that while numerous digital health platforms support basic fitness tracking and monitoring, few systems effectively combine predictive modeling, personalized intervention planning, and intelligent coaching within a single integrated framework. Most existing solutions emphasize data collection and visualization rather than delivering adaptive, real-time, and personalized health decision support.
